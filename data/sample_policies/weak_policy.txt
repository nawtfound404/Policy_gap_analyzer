1. Roles and Responsibilities
The organization defines and documents cybersecurity roles and responsibilities.
System owners, data owners, and administrators are accountable for implementing
and enforcing security controls within their scope of responsibility.
Management ensures accountability through periodic reviews and enforcement actions.

2. Asset Management
The organization maintains an up-to-date inventory of information assets,
including hardware, software, and data assets.
Each asset is assigned an owner and classified based on sensitivity and criticality.

3. Risk Management
The organization performs periodic risk assessments to identify threats,
vulnerabilities, likelihood, and potential impact.
Risk appetite and tolerance levels are defined by management, and risks are treated
through mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or avoidance strategies.

4. Policy Review and Update
Cybersecurity policies are reviewed annually or upon significant changes.
All policy updates require management approval and are version-controlled.

5. Access Control
Access to systems and data is restricted based on the principle of least privilege.
Authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to ensure only
authorized users can access organizational resources.

6. Data Security
Sensitive data is classified and protected using encryption.
Encryption mechanisms are applied to data at rest and data in transit in accordance
with organizational standards.

7. Security Awareness and Training
All employees receive mandatory cybersecurity awareness training upon onboarding
and at least annually thereafter.
Training effectiveness is reviewed periodically.

8. Platform Security
Systems are securely configured using approved baselines.
Patch management and system hardening practices are implemented to reduce
vulnerabilities.

9. Continuous Monitoring
Security events are logged and monitored continuously.
Alerting mechanisms are in place to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

10. Incident Management
The organization maintains an incident response plan.
Roles, escalation procedures, and response timelines are clearly defined.
Incidents are documented, analyzed, and handled according to the response plan.

11. Incident Communication
Relevant stakeholders are notified during cybersecurity incidents through defined
communication channels.
Escalation communication procedures are followed during major incidents.

12. Incident Analysis
Security incidents are investigated to determine root cause.
Forensic analysis is performed when necessary to support incident response.

13. Recovery Planning
Regular backups are performed for critical systems.
Recovery plans define restoration procedures and include post-incident reviews
to improve resilience.

14. Recovery Communication
During recovery activities, stakeholders receive regular status updates
until systems are fully restored.
