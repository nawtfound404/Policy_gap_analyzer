Introduction
The Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) is offering this
guide to participants of the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review (NCSR) and MSISAC members, as a resource to assist with the application and advancement of
cybersecurity policies.
The policy templates are provided courtesy of the State of New York and the
State of California. The templates can be customized and used as an outline of an
organizational policy, with additional details to be added by the end user.
The NCSR question set represents the National Institute of Standards and
Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). This guide gives the correlation
between 49 of the NIST CSF subcategories, and applicable policy and standard
templates. A NIST subcategory is represented by text, such as “ID.AM-5.” This
represents the NIST function of Identify and the category of Asset Management.
For additional information on services provided by the Multi-State Information
Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), please refer to the following page: https://
www.cisecurity.org/ms-isac/services/. These policy templates are also mapped to
the resources MS-ISAC and CIS provide, open source resources, and free FedVTE
training: https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CybersecurityResources-Guide.pdf.
Disclaimer: These policies may not reference the most recent applicable NIST
revision, however may be used as a baseline template for end users. These policy
templates are not to be used for profit or monetary gain by any organization.
